The current document was prepared as part of a project for the course "Exploratory Data Analysis", offered by Coursera and Johns Hopkins University under the "Data Science" Specialization.

The original data were collected from the UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository and can be found at http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/. For the scope of the project the “Individual household electric power consumption Data Set” was used which represents measurements of electric power consumption in one household with a one-minute sampling rate over a period of almost 4 years. The data can be downloaded from:

A detailed description is available at:

The data were loaded into R and processed in order to convert the variables to the right types and select data from dates between 2007-02-01 and 2007-02-02.
Using the resulting data set, four R scripts were created, namely plot1.R, plot2.R, plot3.R and plot4.R, in order to replicate the required plots (plot1.png, plot2.png, plot3.png and plot4.png respectively).


The project includes the following files:

    'README.md'

    'plot1.png', 'plot2.png', 'plot3.png', 'plot4.png': the produced plots

    'plot1.R', 'plot2.R', 'plot3.R', 'plot4.R': the R scripts used to produce the above plots (the scripts assume that file 'household_power_consumption.txt' is has been manually downloaded and is available in the working directory)
